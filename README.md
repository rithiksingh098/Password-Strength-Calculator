# Password-Strength-Calculator

Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks. In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability. 

To compute the strength of the password, we had 3 components. 

• Password Generator

• Strength Compute Unit

• User Interface 

### Input

User is supposed to input his First name , Last name and Email id.

Then Set a password.

### Output

The system would then tell IF the password is 

# LOW
# MEDIUM
# HIGH
